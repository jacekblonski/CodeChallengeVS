# CodeChallengeVS
=================
Installation
-------------
Solution and project files for Visual Studio are included but both projects can also be run without needing Visual Studio:

Question 1:

1) You will need to download and install .NET Core 3.1 SDK or later (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
2) Download the project folder
3) Set "FilePath" in appsettings.Development.json to where you want messages to be saved
4) Open the command line and change directory to the project folder
3) Enter "dotnet run"
4) The API should now be running on your localhost

Question 2:

This is a flat html file with a css file and a script file so simply placing the contents of the project folder in an appropriate directory will let you open it locally or host it if placed on a web server.
